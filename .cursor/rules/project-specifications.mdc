I want to build a mobile app named "kaleening". Objective is to Offer carpet cleaning services to mosques.

## Considerations

### Mosques: Each mosque will have

- Location including google map location
- full address
- size in carpet area
- floors
- authorized SPOC user

### Users:

- User can self register.
- After they register they can request to become an authorized contact for a partical mosque.
- This request has to be approved by either an admin or the authorized SPOC
- An authorized contact can reqeust for a cleaning appointment
- Can add new mosque for approval

### Admins:

- An admin is a user who has admin rights
- Admin can view cleaning requests take action on them (e.g. schedule or close)
- Admin can approve users as authorized contact
- Admin can add new mosques or approve new mosques
- Each user will register using email / phone.

### Appointments

- User can request an appointment
- An admin will schedule the appointment
- An admin can close the appointment
